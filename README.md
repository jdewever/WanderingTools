# WanderingTools
Aims to provide some nice features / tools related to Wandering Traders

## Features
- A message broadcast when a trader spawns, with their location and any notable trades.
  - A global sound cue on a legendary trade. (Both notable and legendary trades based on our skyblock)
- When also installed on the client, show the ticks until a spawn attempt will be made and the chance in the F3 screen.

## Issues
- All notable and legendary items are hardcoded for now.

## Planned
- A Wandering Trader spawn thread per player.
- The F3 info showing the players own spawn-thread info.
- Ability to add / remove notable & legendary trades, messages and soundcue.
